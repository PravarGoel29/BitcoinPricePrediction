# BitcoinPricePrediction
The project involves predicting the price of Bitcoin using a machine learning model.

1. Data Collection: The historical Bitcoin price data is collected from Yahoo Finance.

2. Data Preparation: The collected data is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any missing values and outliers.

3. Feature Engineering: A set of features are selected and extracted from the data, which are relevant for predicting the price of Bitcoin.

4. Model Selection: A machine learning model is selected for predicting the price of Bitcoin. Initially, a simple linear regression model is used, followed      by a random forest regression model, and finally, an XGBoost regression model with hyperparameter tuning using grid search.

5. Model Evaluation: The performance of the machine learning model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.

6. Visualization: The results of the model are visualized using various plots such as scatter plot, line plot, and residual plot.


Overall, the project demonstrates how to use machine learning algorithms to predict the price of Bitcoin, starting from data collection to model    selection and evaluation.
